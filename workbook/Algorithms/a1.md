### Algorithms

    - Space Complexity: How much memory does it require
    - Time Complexity: How much time does it take to complete? 

#### Inputs and output
    - What does the algorithm accept and what are the results?

Classification 
Serial/ Parallel, exact/approximate, deterministic/non-determinstic


#### Common ALGS
    - find specific data in a structure

#### Sort algorithms
    - Take  a dataset and apply a sort order to it 

#### Computational ALGS
    - Given one set of data, calculate another 

#### Collections ALGS

    - Work with collections of data (count)
